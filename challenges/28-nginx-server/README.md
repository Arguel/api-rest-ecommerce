## Requirements:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) (Latest Features) (version >= 14.0.0)

## Notes:

Normally the main file is in the <code>dist/</code> folder with the name of <code>index.js</code> or <code>server.js</code>, to execute them you have to navigate to their corresponding folder and launch them with node as follows (example):

<code>node .\dist\server.js</code>

## To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Go to the challenge folder:
   <br/> For example <code>C:\api-rest-ecommerce\challenges\17-sqlite3\ </code>

2. Run the following commands on the console:

   - <pre><code>git init</code></pre>
   - <pre><code>npm install</code></pre>

3. And then you only need to start the server, and for that there are 2 options:

   - using the <code>npm start</code> command (may fail depending on the challenge)

   - running the <b>"server.js"</b> file with node, you can use the following command <code>node server.js</code> (first you have to position yourself in the appropriate folder, which is usually <code>challenges/X-challenge/server/dist</code>

In case of errors with the dependencies you can uninstall the following:

- <pre><code>npm uninstall husky</code></pre>
- any other dependencie causing error (unlikely)
